// 7 kyu - Emily's Eccentric Encoding
// The encoding replaces all lower case letters in a string with the opposite letter in the alphabet. In other words: a -> z, b -> y, c -> x, d -> w, etc. All other characters remain the same. The two parties have agreed on the encoding and they have generated encoded messages like:
//
// "I dlfow orpv gl rmgviervd lm Mlmwzb nlimrmt!"
// which decodes to:
//
// "I would like to interview on Monday morning!"
// Your job is to write a method called decode that takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string as output.
