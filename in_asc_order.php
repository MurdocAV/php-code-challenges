<!-- 7 kyu- Are the numbers in order?

Are the numbers in order?
In this Kata, your function receives an array of positive integers as input. Your task is to determine whether the numbers are in ascending order.

For the purposes of this Kata, you may assume that all inputs are valid (i.e. arrays containing only positive integers with a length of at least 2).

For example:

in_asc_order([1, 2, 4, 7, 19]); // true
in_asc_order([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); // true
in_asc_order([1, 6, 10, 18, 2, 4, 20]); // false
in_asc_order([9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]); // false (NOTE: because the numbers are in DESCENDING order, not ascending order) -->
